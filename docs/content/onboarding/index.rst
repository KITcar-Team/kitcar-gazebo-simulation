Onboarding
==========

**Welcome to KITcar Simulation's Onboarding!**
Here, you can dive into our repository and get ready to join the team.
You will be introduced to the fundamental structure of the repository,
find out how we use ROS, and write your own Python node.
There are also several tasks you need to complete!

We write most of our code in **Python3.8**.
Even if you have never used Python before, you will probably be able to read through \
the Onboarding and understand almost everything.
However, to complete the tasks, you will need to write code yourself.
If you haven't used Python before, you can take a look at one of the many Python courses \
available online.
Here are just a few suggestions:

- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

Before we get started, you need to install **kitcar-gazebo-simulation** \
