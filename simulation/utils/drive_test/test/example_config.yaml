# This is example config file used for simulalation.utils.drive_test.run
# You can execute this script with:
# python3 -m simulation.utils.drive_test.run --config $PATH_TO_CONFIG

# A list of columns which should be shown as a result.
# Every parameter listed in 'tests' can also be a table column howver "conclusion" is a special one: It shows
# must_succeed on the left and the expeded result on the right of the column.
table_header:
- desc
- road
- time_limit
- result
- conclusion

# The max width a column is allowed to have
# (To turn this off: set it to 0)

# Defaults get applied to every test
default_args:
  mission_mode: 2
  gui: false
  time_limit: 300
  must_succeed: true

# A list of tests which should be executed
tests:
- desc: Intersection right # The name of the Test
  road: ci_roads/intersection # The road to test on
  environment: # Some environment variables to adjust the road
    INTERSECTION_RULE: 0
    INTERSECTION_TURN: 2
  # In combination with the default args, this will result in the commands:
  # $ export INTERSECTION_RULE=0
  # $ export INTERSECTION_TURN=2
  # $ rostest simulation_evaluation drive.test mission_mode:=2 gui:=false
  #   time_limit:=300 road:=ci_roads/intersection
  # Checkout ``simulation/models/env_db/ci_roads/intersection.py`` to see
  # how the environment variables are used to modify the road.
  # Optionally add more ros args! Like:
  # - seed: KITCAR
  # - record_rosbag: True
