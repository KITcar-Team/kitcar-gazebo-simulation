# Determine where the car will be driving
# The path must be a list of dictionaries which all have a start and an offset.
# The start defines at which arclength along the road the car starts to drive.
# The offset specifies at which y distance relative to the middle line the car will drive.
#
# If multiple entries are within the list, the car will drive with the specified offset
# starting at the first arclength until the next the next entry changes the offset.
path:
  - start: 0
    offset: -0.2
