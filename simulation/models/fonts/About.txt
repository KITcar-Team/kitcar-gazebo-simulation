Open Din Schrifte Engschrift
Paulo Silva, jun'09 - OFL license

The idea of this open typeface is being the most close as possible from the Prussian Railways master drawing (public domain license, afaik), and its applications.

This typeface were made using open-source tools, like Fontforge and Inkscape, also for helping their development from using them.
